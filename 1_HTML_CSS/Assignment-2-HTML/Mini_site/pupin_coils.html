					<p>
						Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called
						<q><em>Pupin coils</em></q> , followed closely on the pioneering
						work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside,
						which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of
						the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were
						acquired by American Telephone [&] Telegraph (AT&T), making him
						wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use
						of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by
						George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with
						Campbell's own patent.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p class="moretext">
						AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was
						immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of
						long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
